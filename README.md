Can be:
    1. A personal portfolio
    2. A landing page for a product or service of your choice. It must be a specific item or service, not a general category of item or brand.

The content of your website must be original, substantial, and informative.
The quality of the content, in addition to its presentation, will be a major factor in your grade.
You may choose for the content of the website to be whatever you like according to your chosen topic.
For example, if you choose to create a personal portfolio, you may include information about yourself, your resume, your work experience, your education, your skills, etc.
If you choose to create a landing page for a product or service, you may include information about the product, its features, its benefits, its price, etc.

Grading
The grading of the project will be divided into 2 distinctions, required and optional tasks.
The required tasks will account for 60% of your grade, while the optional tasks will account for the 40%.
You may choose to do as many optional tasks as you would like, but the maximum grade possible is 100% and a maximum of 5% may be used as "bonus" for points lost on the required tasks (if you have 5% of bonus points, you may lose 5% of the required tasks and still get 100% of the grade).
Following your completion of the project, submit a PDF of the completed form on the last page of this document, with a description of how the project went for you.

A Reminder of AI Usage
    I will always encourage the use of AI to help you with your coursework, but to be wise and accountable in its use.
    For each instance that AI is used, you must disclose it in the comments of your code with a date stamp and the prompt you provided the AI with.
    In general, you may use AI to help you with the design of your website, but the content must be original and created by you.

Good luck and HAVE FUN with this project!
